1. Introduce the problem using pencial and paper

2. After students get tired of calculating by hand suggest writing a program that does the work for them. Students can use either trinket or [Google Colabortory (Colab)](https://youtu.be/xoo4mTujM1U). Google Colab is cool because it integrates with google drive.

  - Sample program in Trinket

Talk about the Collatz conjecture. Share that it is still an open problem worth $1 million and no one knows how to prove it. This can lead to a great discussion on “what does it mean to prove things” and why that matters in math. 
Share the Numberphile video that shows how artists have created a visual representation of the sequence. I recommend starting the video at 2:12.
