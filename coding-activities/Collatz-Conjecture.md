1. Introduce the problem using pencial and paper
  - [Oh Hail the Elephant - Youcubed WIM](https://www.youcubed.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WIM-Oh-Hail-the-Elephant-Grades-6-8.pdf)
2. After students get tired of calculating by hand suggest writing a program that does the work for them. 
  - [Teach modular arithmetic](https://youtu.be/5OjZWSdxlU0) (to test if a number is even)
  - [Sample program in Trinket](https://trinket.io/python/37fae0a0f9)
  - [Sample program in Colab ](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KM3fXUNxg_KuiYvTGVckDt_MU3yzQGk4?usp=sharing)
 
3. Talk about the Collatz conjecture. Share that it is still an open problem worth $1 million and no one knows how to prove it. This can lead to a great discussion on what does it mean to *prove* things and why that matters in math. 
4. Next, I share the Numberphile video that shows how artists have created a visual representation of the sequence. I recommend starting the video at 2:12. There is also a pdf that can be printed and shared with students that they can color. Finally I show the YouTube video *Visualizing Collatz* response which is a response to the Numberphile video. There is also a handy blog that contains all of the Numberphile resources on the Collatz Conjecture.

    - Project Euler is a collection of math problems designed to be solved with code. It is language agnostic so you so can solve the problems using whatever language you would like. They problem 14 on the website deals with the Collatz Conjecture.
