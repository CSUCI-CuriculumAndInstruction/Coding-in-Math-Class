## Learning to Code

Let students explore the [trinket.io](https://trinket.io) intro to coding. It is web-based, with nothing to install. Low floor: no prior coding experience needed. Students edit existing code and see how the output changes.

Let students choose which culminating activity they want to code. Of the entire introduction to python, this is the only thing that I would consider grading. I use it as a formative assessment for the coding. If students seem to grasp it, we move om. If not, maybe we need to spend more time with the basics.

- [Open-ended Exercise with turtles](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/put-it-all-together/pick-an-open-ended-exercise)
That being said, students will probably need some more basic skills before they create programs from scratch. Trinket offers more tutorials. I learned a ton of what I know from Al Sweigart, Corey Schafer, and kind strangers on the internet.

For future projects students can use either [trinket.io](https://trinket.io) or [Google Colabortory (Colab)](https://youtu.be/xoo4mTujM1U). Trinket is great because the interface is clean, you can output cool drawings using the turtle module, but it is only free for python 2. Google Colab is cool because it integrates with google drive. It is built on the open-sourced Jupyter Notebook and designed for data science applications.
