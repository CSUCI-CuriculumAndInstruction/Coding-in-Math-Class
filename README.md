# Coding-in-Math-Class

##Learning to Code

1. Let students explore the [trinket.io](https://trinket.io) intro to coding. It is web-based, with nothing to install. Low floor: no prior coding experience needed. Students edit existing code and see how the output changes. 
  - A Visual Introduction to Python on Trinket.io
2. Let students choose which culminating activity they want to code. This is the only thing that I grade. Serves as a formative assessment for the coding. 
  - Open-ended Exercise with turtles
3. Students will probably need a little more to get going before they create programs from scratch. Trinket offers more tutorials as well as some awesome string challenges.
