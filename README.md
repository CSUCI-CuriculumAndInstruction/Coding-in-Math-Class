## Learning to Code

1. Let students explore the [trinket.io](https://trinket.io) intro to coding. It is web-based, with nothing to install. Low floor: no prior coding experience needed. Students edit existing code and see how the output changes.

2. Let students choose which culminating activity they want to code. This is the only thing that I grade. Serves as a formative assessment for the coding. 
  - [Open-ended Exercise with turtles](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/put-it-all-together/pick-an-open-ended-exercise)
3. Students will probably need a little more to get going before they create programs from scratch. Trinket offers more tutorials as well as some awesome string challenges.
