# Coding-in-Math-Class
This repository is designed to help math teachers bring coding using the python computer programming language into their classrooms. Even if you as the teacher have zero coding experience, you can go through the introduction below with students and learn together. I owe a lot of my own coding knowdledge to kind strangers on the internet. This is an attempt to pay it forward. I am also more than happy to help however I can. 

## Learning to Code

Let students explore the [trinket.io](https://trinket.io) intro to coding. It is web-based, with nothing to install. As with all great resources it has a low floor and a high ceiling. Students do not need prior coding experience. Students edit existing code and see how the output changes.

Let students choose which culminating activity they want to code. Of the entire introduction to python, this is the only thing that I would consider grading. I use it as a formative assessment for the coding. If students seem to grasp it, we move om. If not, maybe we need to spend more time with the basics.

That being said, students will probably need some more basic skills before they create programs from scratch. Trinket offers more tutorials and I recommend checking out the other resources to take your coding to the next level.

For future projects students can use either [trinket.io](https://trinket.io) or [Google Colabortory (Colab)](https://youtu.be/xoo4mTujM1U). Trinket is great because the interface is clean, you can output cool drawings using the turtle module, but it is only free for python 2. Google Colab is cool because it integrates with google drive. It is built on the open-sourced Jupyter Notebook and designed for data science applications.
