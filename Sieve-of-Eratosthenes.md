## Sieve of Eratosthenes

1. The [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is an algorithm for finding prime numbers up to a given number n. Write down a list of positive integers. Start with 2, which is prime, then cross off the remaining multiples of 2. Move to the next number not yet crossed off. Cross off any remaining multiples of that number. Repeat until you reach n (Bonus question: if you only need to check up to the square root of n, why?). Eddie Woo has a great mini-lecture on it.

2. Recreate the Sieve of Eratosthenes using python. (This problem was suggested by u/shoombabi on Reddit.)
